Popular Movies App

This app is the first and second projects of the Android Developer Nanodegree. The app is designed to help users discover current popular movies by presenting a grid arrangement of movie choices. The user is able to change sort order (most popular or highest-rated), or show a custom list of favorites via a setting. Tapping on a movie poster causes the app to transition to a details screen with additional information such as the title, a movie poster image, a plot synopsis, a rating, the release date, reviews, and links to trailers.

All information is pulled from themoviedb.org API via a network call. The data is then stored in an SQLite database using a ContentProvider. The app is also tablet-optimized.
