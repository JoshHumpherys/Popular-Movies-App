Popular Movies App (Project 1)

This app is the first project of the Android Developers Nanodegree. The app presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie choices. The user is able to change sort order (most populat or highest-rated) via a setting. Tapping on a movie poster causes the app to transition to a details screen with additional information such as the title, a movie poster image, a plot synopsis, a user rating, and the release date.

All information is pulled from themoviedb.org API.
